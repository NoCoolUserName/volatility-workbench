# Workbench validation — experimental first version

## Theme selector — 2026-10-07

The static Workbench UI was opened in the in-app browser against a local static
server. Selecting Soft black and white produced an almost-black background,
off-white text, and a neutral gray accent. Selecting Light blue changed the
background and accent to the blue palette, and the selected option survived a
reload. This isolated preview has no Workbench API, so its connection error is
expected. The existing 22 UI tests passed under the repository virtual
environment; JavaScript syntax passed. No memory analysis or report operation
was run. The header was also adjusted for the narrow preview viewport.

Validation: 2026-10-04 UTC. Assessment: **ready with stated limitations for the
local Apple-silicon/Codex use case**. This records project-team implementation
review and testing, not an independent security audit or forensic certification.
Private receipts, screenshots, actual paths, and memory outputs are excluded from Git.

## Automated checks with harmless fixtures

- The full suite completed 57 passing tests and one expected skip for the optional
  addon tests that require the separate Volatility environment. This included nine
  initial UI tests. After focused repairs, all 17 affected UI tests passed, for
  65 distinct passing core/protocol/report/UI checks across these runs.
- The UI tests exchange real stdio MCP messages with the existing server code and
  a clearly synthetic analyzer. Codex responses are simulated; no model API or real
  malware is used in CI. Existing protocol checks verify the core's six tools
  without reporting configuration or UI imports.
- Covered: readiness, provenance/links, report sealing, source preservation, same
  conversation follow-ups, immutable prior versions, grouped/separate captures,
  input and artifact path/symlink rejection, bounded large-output reads, duplicate
  request IDs, queued-work cancellation, interrupted readiness, restart recovery,
  missing-symbol limitations, changed evidence/run identity rejection, unsupported
  approvals, explicit command and MCP form decisions, and enforced-policy mismatch.
- Real local HTTP checks covered authentication, cross-origin/Host rejection,
  action requests without Origin, cookie flags, and refresh without new jobs.
- Python compilation and JavaScript syntax checks passed. A wheel built without
  installing dependencies and included all UI static assets. Importing the core
  server in isolated Python imported neither the UI nor reporting module. The UI
  adds no runtime dependency beyond the core's existing dependencies.

## Actual browser checks

Headless installed Chrome was driven with Playwright 1.63.0 from a temporary
validation installation, not a UI dependency. A harmless fixture exercised path
registration, readiness, first report, executive-summary placement, evidence-link
navigation, reload/reconnection, case question, second sealed report, and Stop.
No JavaScript page errors were recorded. UI state and completed work survived
refresh without duplicate scans. The fixture agent/analyzer were simulated.
A final browser check against the real case verified three report versions,
saved-evidence navigation, and inert rendering of controlled HTML/script-like
text and unsafe link syntax, again with no JavaScript errors.

The macOS native file-picker AppleScript compiled successfully. Interactive Finder
selection was not exercised; it remains a manual platform check. Other browsers,
accessibility assistive technologies, and non-macOS hosts remain unverified.

## Real Codex and Volatility integration

- Installed Codex 0.160.0 app-server initialized over stdio and reported existing
  ChatGPT authentication. No model provider, API key, or billing mode was changed.
  The actual generated protocol schema was inspected before implementation.
- A dedicated private case thread reported read-only sandboxing and on-request
  approvals routed to the user. Codex's state database required a specific approved
  execution outside the implementation session's workspace filesystem sandbox;
  the Workbench did not alter global Codex settings or disable its sandbox.
- Browser-driven readiness used a single existing Windows training image. Actual
  MCP banner and Windows info discovery succeeded and saved complete outputs.
  Source integrity checks passed. No exhaustive investigation was performed.
- The first agent-initiated process-list request was rejected before execution
  because MCP form elicitation was not supported yet. The first report correctly
  documented this gap. A sealed report is structurally valid and preserved; it is
  not proof of complete investigative coverage.
- A real follow-up after application restart resumed the same case thread and
  answered from saved outputs. An explicit report update produced a second sealed
  version without changing the first version's checksums or running more analysis.
- The second review repaired MCP form approvals. The exact scoped PsList request
  was inspected and approved once through the browser; the actual process-list
  execution then succeeded with unchanged source identity. No persistent approval
  rule was granted. The earlier failed-request evidence and report versions remain
  preserved. A third sealed revision incorporated the successful process inventory;
  all six readiness/report/question/update jobs completed. The final case has
  exactly three analyzer runs: banners, Windows info, and PsList. Follow-up report
  revisions reused outputs instead of rescanning.

## Two focused review-and-repair cycles

Cycle 1 corrected interruption classification, a turn-start/Stop race, and
synchronous report packaging that could block browser responsiveness. Stop now
marks interrupted work incomplete, handles an accepted turn whose response is
still pending, and waits for outstanding packaging tasks. Packaging checks every
run's source identity against case readiness before combining evidence. Large
activity/message previews are explicitly truncated while private originals remain.
Regression checks covered source mismatch, bounded reads, and policy overrides.

Cycle 2 inspected actual saved run records, exposing the unsupported MCP form
approval rather than accepting a successful chat/report turn as proof that PsList
ran. The form handler now waits for an explicit decision and validates submitted
content. Unsupported forms fail closed. Failed MCP requests without a core run
are preserved as separate artifacts and investigation steps; they are not fabricated
as successful runs or attributed to a different plugin. Both focused regressions
passed and the repaired approval was exercised through the real browser/agent/MCP
path. No third review cycle was performed.

## Limits

No independent proof of analytical correctness, complete symbol/plugin coverage,
or malware attribution is claimed. Report content and classification require human
review. Native selection interaction, other host platforms/clients/browsers,
complex/URL/device approval flows, long-running resource exhaustion, and forced
process-death recovery remain limited or unverified. SIGKILL cannot guarantee child
cleanup. Core hashing/conversion can delay cancellation; disk output has no quota.
The app-server/dynamic-tool API is experimental and may change in later Codex builds.
The UI is local-only, not a multi-user service or security sandbox. Model excerpts
may leave the machine through the configured AI service.

## Scoped analysis preauthorization follow-up

Workbench now sets the documented MCP `default_tools_approval_mode = "approve"`
for its case-scoped Volatility server on both thread start and resume. Global
Codex configuration, the read-only sandbox, and disabled shell tools are unchanged.
A regression test checks both new and resumed thread configuration.

The installed Codex 0.160.0 app-server completed a real authenticated turn through
the Workbench and scoped MCP server: a harmless simulated Volatility `run_plugin`
call completed, saved one analysis run, preserved the fixture, and raised zero
approval prompts. This checks the real agent/MCP approval path, not the accuracy
of memory analysis. No private memory image was analyzed. The 18 UI checks passed;
the HTTP check required permission to bind localhost outside the restricted test
sandbox. Tests also exposed an unclosed activity-log reader, repaired with a
context manager. Restart Workbench to apply the policy to loaded case threads.

## Stale running instance follow-up

The reported repeat approval prompts came from a Workbench backend started before
scoped tool preauthorization was committed. Reopening the launcher had reused that
backend; installing new source did not replace code already loaded in memory.
The affected process was gracefully restarted, preserving completed artifacts and
marking its paused request incomplete. The replacement session's application-code
fingerprint matched the installed code.

The launcher now rejects reopening an instance with a stale or absent code
fingerprint and explains how to restart it. Regression checks cover matching,
stale, and legacy fingerprints and exercise the locked-instance launch path to
verify that it does not reopen the browser. All 20 UI checks passed. A real
Codex-to-scoped-MCP turn using the harmless simulated analyzer completed with one
saved run, zero approval prompts, and unchanged source bytes. No private image
was reanalyzed for this verification.

## Readable UTC timestamps

New execution/state timestamps use `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SSZ`. New run/report and
registration-backup directories use `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SSZ` plus a random suffix.
Tests cover same-second name uniqueness, provenance timestamp parsing, old and
new GUI formats, elapsed-time parsing, and unchanged non-UTC strings. The full
suite ran 71 tests successfully with one optional test skipped. The isolated
symbol-cache helper's CLI was also checked after preserving its standalone import
behavior. No memory analysis was rerun.

A read-only Chrome check against existing private case data verified three report
version labels, 76 evidence labels, and an original evidence link, with no browser
console errors. Initial browser harness waits assumed a disconnected Codex label;
correcting the harness to wait for the loaded case resolved that test-only issue.
The running investigation finished before Workbench was restarted. Existing raw
artifacts, sealed bundles, paths and hashes were not migrated or rewritten.

## U.S. Central display with Zulu reference

The GUI now formats timestamps through `Intl.DateTimeFormat` with the explicit
`America/Chicago` zone, independent of the browser's local timezone. Labels use
the Central calendar date, CST/CDT, and the original UTC clock in parentheses.
UTC metadata, raw artifact content, filenames, and actual link targets stay intact.
The two focused timestamp tests passed, including summer/winter, both 2026 DST
boundaries, midnight, year/date rollover, legacy labels, and elapsed-time parsing.
A live read-only Chrome check verified three report labels, 76 evidence labels,
and an original evidence link without console errors. An active investigation
was left running; refreshing the browser loads the updated static JavaScript.

## Stable per-image decorative coins

The prior private report assets were located and visually inspected: antique
silver concentric rims, graphite metal, emerald circuitry, curved lettering,
and distinct worm/gear and lightning/chip centers. Their original PNG bytes were
reused for their saved image identities; no private artwork or hashes are tracked.
A synthetic SVG companion was rendered and visually inspected against that design
vocabulary. It is a stylized local renderer, not a new image-generation service.

Four focused coin tests and 21 Workbench tests passed. Checks covered stable assets
across cases/reopening, distinct images, escaped labels, symlink rejection,
metadata-only generation with subprocess creation forbidden and nonexistent source
images, authenticated image serving, portable Markdown asset links and checksums,
unchanged prior report revisions, and report completion when artwork fails.
A test fixture initially used the platform's symlinked temporary-directory alias;
resolving that fixture path preserved the production symlink boundary.

Read-only Chrome checks verified both original PNGs byte-for-byte in image and
report areas, successful reopening, and no console errors. A browser-only synthetic
two-image case verified two identity coins and two portable report image links.
The existing incomplete report remained incomplete; its viewer can display the
coin without inventing report content. Eleven historical report/artwork/checksum
markers were unchanged. The standalone core import did not load the UI/coin layer.
No real Volatility analysis or source-image hashing was performed for this feature.
The active user investigation was allowed to finish before reloading Workbench.

## Coin enlargement interaction

A read-only Chrome interaction check verified that clicking a coin opens a larger
image, left-clicking either the image or backdrop dismisses it, right-clicking
keeps it open, and Enter/Escape provide keyboard access. The normal browser
context menu remains available for saving the image; no custom download handler
was added. JavaScript syntax passed and no browser console errors occurred.
No test suite, analysis jobs, or report regeneration ran for this UI change.

## Saved-artifact inspector integration

The case-scoped MCP server now exposes seven tools including `inspect_artifact`;
readiness's expected tool inventory and new/resumed case guidance were updated.
All 21 existing Workbench tests passed, and an additional inspection test packages
and seals a synthetic revision with derived inspection runs, source-artifact links,
and checksums under the existing report schema. The scoped MCP transport was tested
directly with real tool discovery/calls; no generic shell capability was enabled.
See [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md#saved-artifact-inspection-and-regex-repair) for
actual saved-evidence verification and parser limitations.

The idle local Workbench was restarted through its existing desktop launcher after
checking that no jobs were active or queued. Its runtime fingerprint matched the
updated code, and an authenticated read-only HTTP request retrieved the private
inspection supplement. Case IDs, conversation IDs, report records and job count
were preserved. No new job or model turn was submitted; this was an HTTP integration
check, not a new browser interaction test or report-generation run.


## Saved citation viewer — 2026-10-06

Installed Chrome, using existing Playwright tooling and a synthetic local fixture
server, passed citation listing, exact resolved value/status, raw evidence opening,
inline `#citation=F1:0` links and refresh without JS errors. The fixture created no
Workbench jobs or Volatility subprocesses. Core query/value/provenance checks and
legacy compatibility are recorded in [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md). Active private
Workbench sessions were not restarted; live model behavior was not re-evaluated.


## Coverage view — 2026-10-06

Actual Chrome on an isolated synthetic Workbench passed the Coverage tab's declared
scope/unknown question status, not-run planned filter, attempt drill-down and refresh.
The existing citation/report/evidence controls also passed. No jobs or Volatility
subprocesses were submitted by these views. Real private cases were checked separately
through read-only scoped MCP with subprocess/image-hash guards; the active Workbench
was not restarted. See VALIDATION.md for the 78 targeted tests and offline scenarios.

## Initial case selection — 2026-10-06

Installed Chrome with the actual static UI and intercepted synthetic API responses
passed fresh newest-first selection, selected ID/card/details/chat/report agreement,
and manual selection across the actual background refresh when a newer case arrived.
Valid `?case=` links survived launch-token cleanup; stale IDs fell back to the first
displayed case. Empty lists, removal of the selected case, and later list population
also passed. Switching to a case without reports cleared the old report, and a
delayed response from a previously selected case did not overwrite the current one.
No browser errors occurred. JavaScript syntax and both existing timestamp tests
passed. These were browser fixture checks, not a live backend/investigation test;
no analysis/report-generation requests were made, private cases were untouched,
and no running Workbench was restarted.

## Report coverage sealing regression — 2026-10-06

The automatic report-sealing path now supplies the same case-scoped coverage
backend and recorded jobs as the report-save tool. Previously it replaced the
saved coverage with an unavailable-adapter snapshot; a report retaining real gaps
then failed its mechanical-limitations validation. Sealing also synchronizes that
generated block if the saved snapshot changes before sealing. Authored findings
and all existing evidence/report checks remain subject to validation.

Six focused fixture tests passed: full simulated Workbench save/seal with failed,
partial results; ordinary report generation; follow-up revision and historical
bundle immutability; changed-evidence rejection; nonfatal artwork failure; and
snapshot changes between save and seal. The failed/partial regression blocked
subprocess launches during report save/seal and observed zero calls; the saved
coverage regression also used the existing offline subprocess guard. Setup used
the harmless fake analyzer and simulated Codex, not a real memory investigation.
No private report bundle was rewritten and no active Workbench was restarted.

```

## Pypykatz failure diagnosis — 2026-10-06

The installed third-party plugin was already reachable through Workbench; its
recorded failure was `LSA signature not found!`, followed by `Template guessing
is not applicable for NT5`. A bounded, read-only diagnostic used already-recorded
kernel/process/module metadata to compare the Volatility scanner with direct
page reads inside the affected LSASRV module. Neither found the signature, and
many pages were unreadable. This did not decrypt credentials, dump a process,
scan the whole image, or run the investigation again. The diagnostic and exact
addresses remain private. Missing pages versus an unsupported binary layout is
not fully resolved; credential recovery on that image remains blocked.

The backend now labels that specific failure and supplies actionable guidance;
Workbench investigator instructions discourage unchanged retries. Historical raw
failures are preserved, not relabeled as clean or successful. This is improved
failure handling, not a claim to have repaired missing memory or the upstream
credential parser. The synthetic backend regression checks the saved reason,
failed/nonempty-negative distinction, no reuse, historical response handling
without manifest edits, and no misclassification for unrelated plugins.

The eight-test combined run passed: the six report checks above, the pypykatz
backend regression, and the existing real stdio test in both protocol modes using
the fake analyzer. Fresh connections to both existing Workbench case-scoped MCP
servers discovered the installed plugin and its compatibility guidance without
analysis calls or import failures. These checks do not establish successful
credential extraction or evaluate live-model behavior.

After confirming no active or queued jobs, the local Workbench was gracefully
reloaded and its authenticated state endpoint verified against the updated runtime
fingerprint. Case/image identities, conversations, report records and job statuses
were preserved; 12 historical report/manifest/checksum files retained their hashes.
The browser was reopened with the new local session. No new analysis job or model
turn was submitted, and the earlier failed draft remains preserved as a failed draft.

## Administrative relocation fixture checks

`PYTHONPATH=tests .venv/bin/python -m unittest test_relocation -q` passed three
checks using a physically moved harmless fixture tree and a registered old-root
alias. Saved queries, observable-value citations, history, raw reads, and namespace
identity survived; original manifest bytes remained unchanged. Physical-path inputs
and configuration returned the old logical identity. Inner symlinks, traversal,
invalid mappings, and a retargeted administrative alias were rejected. The saved
query/history check asserted zero subprocess launches. These are local fixture
checks, not an investigation or a claim of unrestricted symlink support.

## Independent Workbench package — 2026-10-07

Extracted from core commit `3ecc22e1275467879005556f5340fbc863bc3281` and tested
against pinned core `376d338494465df402338db9360b48e9e11a7bfc` (0.1.0, API revision 1).
The moved timestamp harness was fixed to evaluate its formatter without executing
DOM-dependent theme startup. All 34 Workbench tests passed, including app/jobs,
report revisions/immutability, inspection provenance, saved citations, coverage,
coins, packaged assets, incompatible-core errors, and updater selection/generation.

`python scripts/package_smoke.py` built a wheel from fresh declared source files,
created an isolated environment, and installed that wheel with its declared core
Git dependency and locked runtime versions. From outside both checkouts it verified
packaged JS/CSS/HTML/template/contract resources, ten tools in both MCP protocol
modes, authenticated HTTP views and console help. The same 34 tests passed against
the installed wheel. A subprocess guard observed zero analysis/model processes for
application startup and viewing. Local editable imports resolved to the sibling
MCP source and this Workbench source; no PYTHONPATH override was used.

The existing Desktop launcher was backed up, updated, and executed from outside
both repositories after the previous Workbench was confirmed idle. It reopened the
same two cases, five report records and 50 jobs. An in-app browser verified newest
case first/initial selection, manual case switching across background refresh,
three historical sealed versions in the older case, original coin loading and zoom,
saved Info evidence-link navigation, case conversation messages and retained failed
job display. Reopening selected the newest case; no browser JavaScript errors were
reported. No readiness/report/question action was submitted.

A read-only saved-data guard inspected 49 history entries and validated existing
sealed bundles with zero subprocess launches. Thirteen historical report, manifest
and checksum markers retained their hashes. No memory-image analysis, re-extraction,
source-image hash, report regeneration or provider change was performed. Existing
configuration, conversation IDs, report identities and the administrative relocation
alias remain in place.

Updater unit fixtures exercised stable-series selection, draft/prerelease rejection,
immutable pin/lock generation, incompatible-series rejection, duplicate-version
no-op and an inert dry run. The live public release lookup found the current tested
core release and made no changes. Candidate PR generation is tested with fixtures;
no fake core release was published merely to manufacture an update PR.

GitHub's Workbench compatibility workflow passed on Python 3.12 and 3.13 after
publication, including installed-wheel tests. Core's separate CI also passed.
The actual manual `Update core` run succeeded as a no-change run against the public
core release. Repository workflow defaults remain read-only; the updater job alone
requests contents/pull-request write access, and the repository permits token-created
PRs. No PAT or additional secret was created. See the
[compatibility run](https://github.com/NoCoolUserName/volatility-workbench/actions/runs/37589967237)
and [manual updater run](https://github.com/NoCoolUserName/volatility-workbench/actions/runs/37590071999).
The moved presentation template's contract link was corrected and the two installed
resource/compatibility checks passed after that documentation-only repair.
