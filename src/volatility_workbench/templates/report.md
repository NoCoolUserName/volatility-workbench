## Executive summary

{{WRITE_AFTER_ANALYSIS: What was found, in the chronology the evidence supports.
Separate observed activity, inferred order, and unknown stages. State supported
impact, key limitation, and confidence. Reference finding IDs. Do not manufacture
initial access or an intrusion story.}}
